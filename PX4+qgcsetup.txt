Step one: download WSL2 with wsl --install in command prompt
	type bash in command prompt to enable linux

step two: navigate to a directory of your choosing and download PX4
	with git clone https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot.git
	navigate to PX4-Autopilot/Tools/setup and run ubuntu.sh

step three: edit settings.json in airsim folder in windows to include 		settings (found in GitHub)

step four: nano ~/.bashrc in wsl to include the following:
	export PX4_SIM_HOST_ADDR=172.31.32.1
	(this ip should be the IP of WSL found on windows) 
	
optional: make sure port 4560 is not being blocked by firewall 

step five: navigate to PX4 main folder and run command:
	make px4_sitl none_iris
	(should take some time for first time run)

optional(if it does not run): if PX4 gives an error, it could be 
	due to wrong empy version. You can install the correct 
	version with python3 -m pip install empy==3.3.4

	go back to main screen and

step nine: go back and manually connect to new link located in 
	the top left of the screen 

step ten: start unreal project from .sln, start px4 in wsl 
	everything should be running and communicating with each other
